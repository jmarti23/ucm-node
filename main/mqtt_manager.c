/**
 * @file mqtt_manager.c
 * @brief MQTT connectivity layer for a UCM sensor node -- owns the MQTT
 *        client lifecycle, topic naming, and all outbound publishes
 *        (node info, environment readings, heartbeats), plus a small
 *        inbound command channel (currently just remote re-provisioning).
 *
 * This is the module that node_main.c's app_main()/sen5x_task() delegate
 * to (mqtt_manager_start(), mqtt_manager_publish_node_info(),
 * mqtt_manager_publish_environment(), mqtt_manager_publish_heartbeat())
 * instead of talking to the esp-mqtt client directly, so all
 * broker/topic/QoS/retain decisions live in one place.
 *
 * TOPIC LAYOUT (publish side, node-specific, all namespaced under
 * "ucm/node-<node_id>/..."):
 *   - ucm/node-<id>/status       "online"/"offline" presence, retained
 *                                 (see publish_online_status() and the LWT
 *                                 setup in mqtt_manager_start()).
 *   - ucm/node-<id>/info         Static identity (name/description/lat/lon),
 *                                 retained, published once via
 *                                 mqtt_manager_publish_node_info().
 *   - ucm/node-<id>/environment  Live sensor readings, NOT retained,
 *                                 published every ~1s via
 *                                 mqtt_manager_publish_environment().
 *   - ucm/node-<id>/heartbeat    Uptime/free-heap/Wi-Fi RSSI health data,
 *                                 NOT retained, published alongside every
 *                                 environment reading via
 *                                 mqtt_manager_publish_heartbeat().
 *
 * TOPIC LAYOUT (subscribe side): see mqtt_event_handler()'s
 * MQTT_EVENT_CONNECTED case -- subscribes to "ucm/node/+/command". Note
 * this uses a *slash* between "node" and the wildcard segment, which does
 * not match the "node-<id>" (hyphenated, no wildcard) pattern used
 * everywhere else in this file for publishing. This is flagged in detail
 * at that subscription site below.
 *
 * BROKER DISCOVERY: connects to "mqtt://UCM-HUB.local", an mDNS hostname
 * rather than a hardcoded IP (contrast with the earlier draft firmware's
 * hardcoded broker IP) -- this assumes mDNS/Bonjour resolution is enabled
 * and working on the network the node is deployed on.
