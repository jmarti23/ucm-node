/**
 * @file node_main.c
 * @brief Main application entry point for the UCM environmental sensor
 *        node firmware.
 *
 * TARGET HARDWARE
 * ----------------
 * - ESP32-P4 dev board (network connectivity brought up via
 *   network_manager.h / app_wifi_prov.h -- this could be Wi-Fi and/or
 *   Ethernet/PoE depending on how network_start() is implemented; this
 *   file itself is agnostic to which transport is used).
 * - Sensirion SEN54/SEN5x environmental sensor (particulate matter,
 *   temperature, humidity, VOC index) wired over I2C.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES, END TO END
 * --------------------------------
 * 1. Initializes NVS (non-volatile storage), required by the network/
 *    provisioning stack to persist configuration data.
 * 2. Initializes the SEN5x sensor over I2C and starts continuous
 *    measurement mode -- done before networking so sensor bring-up isn't
 *    gated on/blocked by the network coming up.
 * 3. Brings up the network connection (network_start()). Only if this
 *    succeeds does the rest of the node's identity/reporting pipeline run:
 *      - Synchronizes the system clock via SNTP.
 *      - Loads this node's stored identity/location (name, description,
 *        GPS lat/lon) via app_wifi_prov_get_node_info().
 *      - Derives a stable, unique node ID from the device's MAC address.
 *      - Starts the MQTT manager and publishes a one-time node-info
 *        message describing this node's identity to the broker.
 * 4. Starts a local web server (see web_server.h) for local access to the
 *    node (e.g. a status page / API) -- this happens unconditionally,
 *    regardless of whether the network/MQTT setup above succeeded.
 * 5. Launches a background task that polls the sensor once per second and
 *    publishes both an environment reading and a heartbeat message to
 *    MQTT via the mqtt_manager module.
 *
 * This is the corrected/current version of the node firmware -- it fixes
 * an issue present in an earlier draft (wifi_test.c) where the network
 * connection result was checked using an undeclared variable name. Here,
 * `network_result` is consistently used both when it's set and when it's
 * checked, and all node-identity/MQTT setup is correctly gated on that
 * same result via the surrounding if/else block.
 *
 * NOTE FOR NEW CONTRIBUTORS: this file is largely AI-generated glue code
 * tying together several ESP-IDF components, a project-specific
 * network/MQTT manager layer, and Sensirion's vendor sensor driver. The
 * comments below explain *why* each piece exists, not just what it does.

 *     which sen5x_device_reset()/sen5x_start_measurement() etc. use
 *     internally to talk to the sensor.
 *  4. sensirion_i2c_esp32_ok() -- sanity check that the ESP32-specific HAL
 *     config succeeded; ESP_ERROR_CHECK'd, so this aborts boot on failure.
 *  5. sen5x_device_reset() -- soft-resets the sensor to a known state.
 *  6. sen5x_start_measurement() -- puts the sensor into continuous
 *     measurement mode so that sen5x_read_measured_values() (used later in
 *     sen5x_task()) will return valid data.
 *
 * Note: unlike step 4, failures in reset/start-measurement (steps 5-6) are
 * only logged, not treated as fatal -- the function just returns early,
 * leaving the sensor task to encounter read errors later.

 * mqtt_manager_publish_environment() and mqtt_manager_publish_heartbeat(),
 * which presumably handle topic naming, payload formatting, retain/QoS
 * flags, and "is MQTT even connected" checks internally.
 *
 * NOTE: this task is started unconditionally in app_main() (even if the
 * network/MQTT never came up), so mqtt_manager_publish_environment() /
 * mqtt_manager_publish_heartbeat() must be safe to call when MQTT isn't
 * connected -- they presumably no-op or fail gracefully in that case,

/**
 * @brief Firmware entry point (called by the ESP-IDF startup code).
 *
 * Overall boot sequence:
 *  1. Initialize NVS flash (erasing and reinitializing it if it's in a bad
 *     state due to a version mismatch or running out of free pages -- this
 *     is the standard ESP-IDF boilerplate pattern for NVS bring-up).
 *  2. Initialize and start the SEN5x sensor (sen5x_init()) BEFORE
 *     networking, so sensor bring-up doesn't depend on/wait for the
 *     network.
 *  3. Bring up the network (network_start()). The result gates everything
 *     related to node identity and MQTT reporting:
 *       - On failure: just logs an error and skips straight past the
 *         identity/MQTT setup block. Node ID is never generated and MQTT is
 *         never started in this case.
 *       - On success:
 *           a. Sync time over SNTP (time_sync_start()).
 *           b. Fetch this node's stored identity/location
 *              (app_wifi_prov_get_node_info()) and copy it into the shared
 *              current_sensor_data struct.
 *           c. Generate this node's unique ID from its MAC address
 *              (generate_node_id()) and log it.
 *           d. Start the MQTT manager (mqtt_manager_start()), passing the
 *              node ID (presumably used to build this node's MQTT topics
 *              and/or client ID). If that succeeds, publish a one-time
 *              node-info message describing this node's identity
 *              (mqtt_manager_publish_node_info()); if it fails, just log an
 *              error and continue booting without MQTT.
 *  4. Start the local web server (start_webserver()) -- this happens
 *     unconditionally, regardless of whether networking/MQTT above
 *     succeeded, so the local status page/API is available even in a
 *     degraded (offline) boot.
 *  5. Launch the recurring sen5x_task() background task that polls the
 *     sensor and publishes readings/heartbeats once per second -- also
 *     started unconditionally.
 *  6. Idle-loop forever, logging a heartbeat message every 10 seconds
 *     (app_main() must not return on ESP-IDF; this keeps the task alive
 *     and doubles as a simple "is the node still alive" log line).
